## Project Overview

This project involves the creation of an **Excel-based interactive dashboard** designed to analyse sales, profit, and expenses across different business dimensions. The dashboard provides key insights into revenue trends, regional performance, product line profitability, customer segmentation, and payment method impact.

- Examined total sales revenue, operational costs, and net profit across transactions.  
- Identified profitable and loss-making transactions.  

### 2. Regional Performance Evaluation  
- Assessed sales and profitability by region (e.g., Europe, Africa, North America).  
- Highlighted top-performing and underperforming regions.  

### 3. Product Line Profitability Analysis  
- Analysed profitability across different product categories (e.g., Software, Electronics, Healthcare).  
- Identified high-revenue and low-performing product lines.  

### 4. Customer Segmentation Insights  
- Categorised customers into **SMB, B2B, and B2C** segments.

### 5. Payment Method Profitability  
- Analysed sales and profit distribution across payment methods (e.g., Cash, Credit Card, Bank Transfer).  
- Determined which payment methods contribute the most to profitability.
